## Context
I love to travel and explore the world. So, when I started to learn web development, an app to combine my passion for travel and the skills that I was learning was the most logical option. I wanted to, not only, create something that would motivate me to plan new trips, but also to have a place where I could revisit my past trips and remember beautiful moments. This is why the Bucket List App came into existence! It's basically an app to travel the world with just your phone.

## Requirements
- To have a todo list of the places that I want to travel to with images;
- To have a list of the places I've been to with photos;
- To have a text editor to store places that I want to go;
- To have a personal page with some statistics of the places I've been and some photos of my favorite trips;
- To have a map with pins of the places I've been and want to go.

## Development
Technologies:
- Kotlin
